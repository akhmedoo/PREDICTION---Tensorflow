# PREDICTION---Tensorflow


1.png >>> Model predicts it as 7, because of the straight line similar with 7
2.png >>> Model predicts it as 2, down side may help it in prediction
3.png >>> Model predicts it as 3, may be the curves of number 3 help it in prediction
4.png >>> Model predicts it as 4, beacuse it looks like print 4
5.png >>> Model predicts it as 5, may be the curves of number 5 help it in prediction
6.png >>> Model predicts it as 5, because if we close down left side, it looks like 5
7.png >>> Model predicts it as 7, because it looks like print 7, and angle between straight lines may help it to predict 7
8.png >>> Model predicts it as 8, 2 circles in the picture may help it to predict number 8
9.png >>> Model predicts it as 9, because it looks like handwriting 9
0.png >>> Model predicts it as 0, because it looks like circle as 0
